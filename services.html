            <h2>Individual Psychotherapy</h2>

            <p>Generally speaking, individual psychotherapy tends to focus on
              your childhood, past experiences and current concerns or problems.
              Through the process of individual therapy, one can often gain an
              understanding of why they feel and behave the way they do.
              Issues, concerns and problems brought
              to therapy are often successfully resolved. Additionally,
              individual psychotherapy yields itself to: personal growth,
              self-actualization, acceptance, and increased self-esteem,
              alleviation of guilt, pain, and undue hardship.
            </p>

            <p>Individuals often come to therapy to work on a variety of
              issues. Issues range from anxiety, depression, low self-esteem,
              grief &amp; loss, phobias, compulsions, quest for meaning,
              relationship concerns, and&mdash;increasingly more common&mdash;unresolved
              feelings of guilt surrounding wealth and success.
            </p>

            <p>Within the 50-minute hour, I invite you to share your
              beliefs, feelings, thoughts, and concerns. Throughout our work
              together, we will utilize this information in an effort to help
              you understand how your (possibly negative) thought patterns
              might influence your behavior. Within this safe, confidential,
              and non-judgmental space, I hope to encourage you to confront and
              take
              charge of your issues, concerns, and problems, and to grow as an
              individual.
            </p>

            <p>I encourage you to learn more about who you are, so you may
              enjoy life more fully. By working to dissipate your unique obstacles,
              roadblocks and barriers, we will discover ways to allow you to
              pursue the life you want to lead. I invite you to find joy,
              peace, empathy and an increased sense of self in therapy.

            <h2>Couples Therapy</h2>

            <p>Couples therapy is a lot like individual psychotherapy, except
              with two people. This, of course, changes the nature of the
              sessions from "I" to "we." In individual therapy, the session is all
              about you. In a couples therapy session, an undercurrent of
              teamwork and collaboration is a must. Within a couples therapy
              dynamic, the couple's therapist is not neutral. I work to help
              you improve your communication techniques with each other in an
              effort for you to possess the highest chance of success.
            </p>

            <p>As with individual therapy, couples therapy builds on stated
              goals, objectives, desires, and a willingness to do the work&mdash;in
              this case, together. You learn about yourself, your partner,
              and create a dialogue where you learn what works and what does
              not. A lot of people aim to learn what kind of life they want
              with a partner, who they want to be as a partner, and what they
              might like their partner to bring to the relationship. Although
              the therapy takes place witht he couple in mind, an individual's
              willingness to be open
              to changing one's self is extremely beneficial. Having a vision,
              positive attitude, the motivation to participate, and the willingness
              to learn and adapt are all positive components for success.

            </p>

            <p>In couples therapy, the importance of effective communication
              cannot be stressed enough. Each partner must be willing to respect
              the other partner, be open to his or her partner&apos;s views and
              opinions, and be persistent about working together. Communicating effectively can be a
              challenge. Taking the time to be empathic towards one another,
              allowing the time needed to understand and be understood, and
              being patient with one another is key. Through this shared communication,
              the couple can grow together, develop a greater understanding of one another,
              better pursue shared goals, and improve upon many other aspects of their
              relationship according to their state desires.

            <h2>Group Therapy</h2>

            <p>Group therapy serves as a complementary addition to individual
              psychotherapy or couples therapy, but can easily stand alone as a
              single therapeutic intervention as well. In most cases, group
              psychotherapy consists of a small number of people (usually
              4 to 8 participants) and one or two trained psychotherapists
              who serve as facilitators to guide and lead the group.
            </p>

            <p>The type of group varies greatly, not only in subject matter but
              in structure and timing. While some groups are highly structured,
              others are more open and varied. While some groups have pre-determined
              start and finish dates, others are on-going for an undetermined
              amount of time. Regardless if the type of groups that I offer,
              commitment and adherence to group norms are essential.

              Within this dynamic, group therapy offers participants the unique
              opportunity to openly share issues, concerns, or problems with other
              members, and to give and receive guidance, support, and understanding
              in return. Because this platform provides space for participants to
              &quot;test the waters&quot; in a safe, controlled, confidential setting,
              one direct result of participation is often the improvement of
              interpersonal relationship skills. A translation of these skills to
              their own life allows participants to improve communication with,
              better understand, and relate to others in their academic, work, and
              social settings.
