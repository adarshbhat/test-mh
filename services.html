            <h2>Individual Psychotherapy</h2>

            <p>Generally speaking, individual psychotherapy tends to focus on
              your childhood, past experiences and current concerns or problems.
              Through the process of individual therapy, one can often gain an
              understanding of why they feel and behave the way they do.
              Issues, concerns and problems brought
              to therapy are often successfully resolved. Additionally,
              individual psychotherapy yields itself to: personal growth,
              self-actualization, acceptance, increased self-esteem,
              alleviation of guilt, pain, and undue hardship.
            </p>

            <p>Individuals often come to therapy to work on a variety of
              issues. Issues range from anxiety, depression, low self-esteem,
              grief &amp; loss, phobias, compulsions, existential angst,
              relationship concerns, and increasingly more common: unresolved
              feelings of guilt surrounding wealth and success.
            </p>

            <p>Within the 50-minute hour, you are invited to share your
              beliefs, feelings, thoughts, and concerns. Throughout our work
              together, this information will be utilized in an effort to help
              you understand how your (sometimes negative) thought patterns
              might influence your behavior. Within this safe, confidential,
              and non-judgmental space, you are encouraged to confront and take
              charge of your issues, concerns, and problems.
            </p>

            <p>I encourage you to learn more about who you are, so you may
              enjoy life more fully. By working through your unique obstacles,
              roadblocks and barriers, interferences preventing you from having
              the life you want often dissipate. I invite you to find joy,
              peace, empathy and an increased sense of self in therapy.
            </p>

            <h2>Couples Therapy</h2>

            <p>Couples therapy is a lot like individual psychotherapy, except
              with two people &mdash; this of course changes the course of what a
              session looks like. In individual therapy, the session is all
              about you. In a couples therapy session, an undercurrent of
              teamwork and collaboration is a must. Within a couples therapy
              dynamic, the couples therapist is not neutral. I work to help
              you improve your communication techniques with each other in an
              effort for you to possess the highest chance of success.
            </p>

            <p>Like with individual therapy, couples therapy builds on stated
              goals, objectives, desires, and a willingness to do the work &mdash;
              in this case, together. You learn about yourself, your partner,
              and create a dialogue where you learn what works and what does
              not. A lot of people aim to learn what kind of life they want
              with a partner, who they want to be as a partner, and what they
              might like their partner to bring to the relationship. Having a
              vision, positive attitude, the motivation to participate and
              willingness to learn and adapt
              (being open to changing one&apos;s self is extremely beneficial) are
              all positive components for success.
            </p>

            <p>In couples therapy, the importance of effective community
              cannot be stressed enough. Each partner must be willing to respect
              the other partner, be open to his or her partner&apos;s views and
              opinions, and be persistent. Communicating effectively can be a
              challenge. Taking the time to be empathic towards one another,
              allowing the time needed to understand and be understood, and
              being patient with one another is key.
            </p>

            <h2>Group Therapy</h2>

            <p>Group therapy serves as a complementary addition to individual
              psychotherapy or couples therapy, but can stand alone as a
              single therapeutic intervention as well. In most cases, group
              psychotherapy consists of a small number of people (usually
              between 4-8) and one or two trained psychotherapists
              serving also as facilitators to guide and lead the group.
            </p>

            <p>Within this dynamic, participants are given the unique opportunity
              to openly share issues, concerns or problems with other members,
              and receive/give guidance, support, and understanding. Because this
              platform provides space for participants to &quot;test the
              waters&quot; in a safe, controlled, confidential setting, and
              improvement in interpersonal relationships are often a direct
              result of participation. These skills gained often translate to
              a better understanding of how they relate to others in academic,
              work, and other social settings.
            </p>

            <p>Groups vary greatly. Some groups are highly structured, while
              others are more open variation. While some groups have
              pre-determined start and finished dates, others are on-going
              for an undetermined amount of time. Regardless of the type of
              group being offered, commitment and adherence to group norms
              are essential.
